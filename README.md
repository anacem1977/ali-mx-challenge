## General Info
Chat-like form built with independent components for Name, Date of Birth and Contact. When the user enters the requested information, it is shown inside a pink frame. Once all the data is captured, a button to "Start" is displayed along with all the information that was captured throughout the components.
Random photos of users are retrieved via API calls and displayed to simulate a real chat.
A functional progress bar was included as well.
